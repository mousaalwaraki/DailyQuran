our destitution in poverty - drive toward us the comforts of life and an abundance of plentiful provisions, turn aside blameworthy character traits and base moral qualities, and preserve us from the pit of unbelief and the motives for hypocrisy, such that the Qur'an may be for us at the resurrection a leader to Thy good pleasure and Thy gardens, for us in this world a protector against Thy displeasure and transgressing Thy bounds and for what is with Thee a witness by its declaring lawful the lawful and its declaring unlawful the unlawful!\n\nO God, bless Muhammad and his Household and through the Qur'an make easy for our souls at death the distress of the driving, the effort of the moaning, and the succession of the rattling, when souls reach the throats and it is said, 'Where is the enchanter?'; when the angel of death discloses himself to seize them from behind the veils of unseen things, letting loose at them from the bow of destinies the arrows of the terror of lonesome separation, and mixing for them from sudden death a cup poisoned to the taste; and when departure and release for the hereafter come close to us, works become collars around the necks, and the graves become the haven until the appointed time of the Day of Encounter!\n\nO God, bless Muhammad and his Household, make blessed for us the arrival at the house of decay and the drawn out residence between the layers of the earth, appoint the graves, after separation from this world, the best of our waystations, make roomy for us through Thy mercy the narrowness of our tombs, and disgrace us not among those present at the Resurrection through our ruinous sins! Through the Qur'an have mercy upon the lowliness of our station at the standing place of presentation to Thee, make firm the slips of our feet during the shaking of the bridge across hell on the day of passage over it, illuminate the darkness of our graves before the Uprising, and deliver us from every distress on the Day of Resurrection and from the hardships of terrors on the Day of Disaster! Whiten our faces on the day when the faces of wrongdoers are blackened during the Day of Regret and Remorse, appoint love for us in the breasts of the faithful, and make not life for us troublesome! O God, bless Muhammad, Thy servant and Thy messenger, just as He delivered Thy message, executed Thy command and counselled Thy servants!\n\nO God, on the Day of Resurrection make our Prophet (Thy blessings be upon him and his Household) the nearest of the prophets to Thee in seat, the ablest of them before Thee with intercession, the greatest of them with Thee in measure, and the most eminent of them with Thee in rank! O God, bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, ennoble his edifice, magnify his proof, make weighty his balance, accept his intercession, bring near his mediation, whiten his face, complete his light, and raise his degree! Make us live according to his Sunna, make us die in his creed, take us on his road, make us travel his path, place us among the people who obey him, muster us in his band, lead us to up his pool, and give us to drink of his cup! And bless Muhammad and his Household, with a blessing through which Thou wilt take him to the most excellent of Thy good, Thy bounty, and Thy generosity for which he hopes! Thou art Possessor of boundless mercy and generous bounty.\n\nO God, repay him for Thy messages which he delivered, Thy signs which he passed on, the good counsel he gave to Thy servants, and the struggle he undertook in Thy way, with the best Thou hast repaid any of Thy angels brought nigh and Thy prophets sent out and chosen! And upon him and his Household, the good, the pure, be peace, God's mercy, and His blessings!"
